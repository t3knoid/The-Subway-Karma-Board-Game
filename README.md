 A board game that last as long as a NYC subway ride.

 ## Introduction

Riding the subway seems like an adventure every time I ride it. The Subway Karma board game hopes to recreate this feeling of adventure anytime. I designed this game during a game design course. I wanted to create a game that I can closely relate to at that time. I also wanted it to be simple and allow the player to customize the lenght of play by adding or removing karma cards.

## Board Setup

Print the board (preferably in color and on card stock). The game board was designed to fit on a standard 8.5" x 11" paper.  The karma card template uses a standard business card template (e.g., Avery Template 5371). Use something like a Avery 5371 business card card stock for a more professional look.

I never got a chance to design any game pieces so you'll have to be creative here. The piece would have to be small enough to fit on the board as to not crowd it especially when there are more than one piece on a square.

## Playing

1. Stack the karma cards in the middle of the game board face down.
2. Start on any station square. Youngest player goes first. Direction of play is clockwise.
3. Use spinner to dictate number of squares to move.
4. Follow instructions on the square you land on
5. Pick up a karma card whenever you land or pass a station. Keep the karma card.
6. Game ends after all karma cards are used.
7. Sum up karma card points at the end of the game. 
8. The player with the most points wins.

## Customizing

Use the Karma Cards.pub file as a template to create new cards.
